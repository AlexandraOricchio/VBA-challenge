# VBA-challenge

Used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and collected the following information:

- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Conditional formatting highlighting positive change in green and negative change in red. 
- Return the stock with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume.
